      <h2>What is a signal?</h2>
      <p>A signal is any observable piece of evidence that informs the reliability, traction, or risk profile of a project. One signal is rarely conclusive; the strength comes from combining multiple independent signals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Signal categories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Founders &amp; team:</strong> verifiable identities, prior outcomes, consistent public presence.</li>
        <li><strong>Product &amp; code:</strong> live product, public repos, release cadence, security posture.</li>
        <li><strong>Traction:</strong> real users, meaningful usage metrics, credible partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> funding history, cap table transparency (when public), revenue hints.</li>
        <li><strong>Market &amp; regulation:</strong> target geography, licensing needs, comparable players.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation:</strong> press coverage, community feedback, incident history.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Why++</h2>
      <p><em>Why++</em> is the short, defensible rationale that stitches your signals into a coherent conclusion. It should be clear enough for a stakeholder to act on, and specific enough to audit later.</p>
      <p>Good Why++ statements are: (1) evidence‑anchored, (2) falsifiable, and (3) scoped to the decision at hand.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to write a solid Why++</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start with the question.</strong> e.g., “Should we integrate X as a data source this quarter?”</li>
        <li><strong>List the strongest signals.</strong> Pick 3–7 independent signals with sources.</li>
        <li><strong>State the conclusion and risk.</strong> “Proceed, gated by security review,” or “Defer; traction unclear.”</li>
        <li><strong>Call out unknowns.</strong> Surface the top 1–3 gaps that could change the decision.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <h3>Proceed (guarded)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Founding team with shipped products; public profiles consistent over 3+ years.</li>
        <li>Live API with uptime history; security page with responsible disclosure.</li>
        <li>Paying customers named; integration docs are adequate.</li>
        <li><em>Why++:</em> Evidence supports a limited integration behind feature flags; revisit in 60 days.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Defer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Domain registered 2 months ago; marketing claims multi‑year traction.</li>
        <li>Missing legal pages; no independent press or case studies.</li>
        <li><em>Why++:</em> Insufficient proof; reassess after credible milestones.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Signals are independent and cited.</li>
        <li>Why++ references the signals directly.</li>
        <li>Risks and unknowns are explicit.</li>
        <li>Decision is actionable and time‑boxed.</li>
      </ul>
